# Kuroba - imageboard browser for Android
## All releases are less dev than actual dev. Do not assume they are stable, but they're more stable than actual dev.

Releases are built by Adamantcheese whenever enough changes have been made and the application is fairly stable:
### [Latest Release APK](https://github.com/Adamantcheese/Kuroba/releases/latest/download/Kuroba.apk)
### [All Release APKs](https://github.com/Adamantcheese/Kuroba/releases)

DEV releases are provided by Github Actions (they are built and uploaded after every new commit):
### [Latest DEV APK](https://github.com/Adamantcheese/Kuroba-Dev/releases/latest/)
### [All DEV APKs](https://github.com/Adamantcheese/Kuroba-Dev/releases)

Kuroba is a fast Android app for browsing imageboards, such as 4chan and 8chan. It adds inline replying, thread watching, notifications, themes, pass support, filters and a whole lot more. It is based on Clover by Floens, but has additional features added in because Floens doesn't want to merge PRs. Credits to K1rakishou for a number of features.
